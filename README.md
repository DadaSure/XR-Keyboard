# Keyboards

This is a repo containing hand tracked keyboard experiments.

## Punch Keyboard (2020)

This repo started off as an adaptation of Punch Keyboard. This is the same project as seen here: https://github.com/rjth/Punchkeyboard, however we removed the drumsticks and replaced them with hands. 
It works okish, but it is quite buggy.

## Interaction Engine Keyboards (2020)

This is a basic implementation of a traditional keyboard in the interaction engine.
We have two seperate input methods:

1. Push
2. Pinch

## Interaction Engine Keyboards 2.0 (2021)

This is a reworked implementation of Interaction Engine Keyboards.
It contains 3 keyboard implementations

1. Interaction Engine Buttons
2. UI Input Module Buttons
3. Interaction Engine Buttons in a UI Canvas

The final solution is also more fully developed, and our current preferred solution.
