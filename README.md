# Keyboards

This is a repo containing hand tracked keyboard experiments.

## Punch Keyboard

This repo started off as an adaptation of Punch Keyboard. This is the same project as seen here: https://github.com/rjth/Punchkeyboard, however we removed the drumsticks and replaced them with hands. 
It works okish, but it is quite buggy.

## Interaction engine keyboards

This is a basic implementation of a traditional keyboard in the interaction engine. We have two seperate input methods - the first is simply making each key a poke-button. The other input is pinch based.
This works a lot better than the punch keyboard.
